## Description
A machine learning pipeline built in Python to:
- load and clean transaction data
- handle class imbalance
- train a Decision Tree model
- evaluate using confusion matrix, classification report and ROC-AUC
- visualize ROC curve and decision tree

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Model
Decision Tree Classifier (class_weight=balanced)

## Dataset
Public credit card fraud dataset (CSV / ZIP supported).

## Note
This script is designed to run in Google Colab.
